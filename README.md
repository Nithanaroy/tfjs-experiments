# Experiments with Tensorflow JS

The problem statements are borrowed from https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow/ course. They are solved using my experiences from Machine Learning and Web Development. 

**Note:** Uses ES7 JavaScript constructs like `async-await` without any transpilation. Tested in Google Chrome version 79
